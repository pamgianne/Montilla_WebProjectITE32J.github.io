                <h3>
                  A Syrian man suspected of planning a bomb attack in Germany has been arrested in the eastern city of Leipzig
                </h3>
                <p>
                  "Tired but overjoyed: we captured the terror suspect last night in Leipzig," Saxony state police said on Twitter.
                </p>
                <p>Police had been looking for the suspect, 22-year-old Jaber Albakr, a Syrian refugee, since he slipped through their grasp during a raid on an apartment in the eastern city of Chemnitz on Saturday.
                They have refused to comment on reports that al-Bakr was in contact with the Islamic State or that he was planning an attack on a German airport.
                Police found several hundred grams of explosive in the apartment during Saturday's raid.</p>
                <p>Albakr had been in Germany since last year and was officially recognised as a refugee, police said at the weekend.
                The suspicion that a refugee was planning a bomb attack will prove unwelcome news for Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose conservatives have lost support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party over her open-door migration policy.
                Merkel, who said last month she wished she could "turn back the time by many, many years" to better prepare for last year's influx of almost 1 million migrants, has yet to say whether she will seek a fourth term as chancellor in elections next year.
                In July, the Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for attacks on a train near Wuerzburg and at a music festival in Ansbach that wounded 20 people.</p>

          <p>(CNN)Politics in America changed Sunday night.


            The once sacred tradition of a presidential debate -- where candidates typically trade barbs over their vision of the country's future -- exploded into something quite chilling.
            The Republican nominee seemingly dismissed the significance of the vulgar language he used toward women a decade ago, apologizing for his conduct but repeatedly saying his remarks were just "locker room talk."
            With Hillary Clinton's husband and daughter watching from the audience, Donald Trump lashed into Bill Clinton's infidelities, calling him "abusive." Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor as president to investigate her -- and even threatened that she would be jailed under his administration.</p>

    <h3 id="3">The Most Dangerous Countries to Travel to</h3>
    <img src="headline.png" width="650px" height="400px">

      <br/>

        <p>By Emily von Hoffmann on August 10, 2016</p>

         <p>From the terror attacks in Nice, France to the ongoing spread of the Zika virus, the past year has been a dizzying one in terms of violence and disease outbreaks throughout the world. These factors, among others, increase the likelihood travelers will be required to stay up to date on travel safety advisories. Using 2016 data from the Canadian government and The Global Health Data Exchange, HealthGrove, a health visualization site by Graphiq, created an ascending list of the most dangerous countries to travel to.

          The Canadian Travel Advice and Advisories data comprises four major categories — “exercise normal security precautions,” “exercise a high degree of caution,” “avoid nonessential travel” and “avoid all travel.” HealthGrove's list includes countries with at least an "exercise a high degree of caution" rating or higher and nations are ranked by worsening travel advisories. Ties were broken by using the Travel Mortality Index, which provides an aggregate score representing the likelihood of death caused by traveling to a given country. The higher the index, the higher the probability of traveler death. The causes of death in the Index vary from diseases like Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS to causes like “interpersonal violence,” “exposure to forces of nature,” “collective violence” and “legal intervention.” The variation in causes explains why you’ll see France, for example, with a score (116.2), which is separated from that of Honduras (120.4) by only a few points. </p>
    <h3 id="4">Egypt is getting a new capital - courtesy of China</h3>
        <p>(CNN)Egypt's new capital city moved a step closer to reality with the announcement that Chinese developers will largely fund the megaproject.

            The China Fortune Land Development Company (CFLD) agreed to provide $20 billion for the currently unnamed city, after a meeting between heads of the firm and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi.
            This follows a previous commitment of $15 billion from another Chinese state-owned company, bringing the project close to its $45 billion budget requirements for phase I.
            Plans for the new capital were first announced in March 2015. Government officials described the development as a solution to crowding, pollution and rising house prices in Cairo.
            "Cairo Capital is a momentous endeavor to build national spirit, foster consensus, provide for long-term sustainable growth," said the project website. "(The) new city will create more places to live, work and visit."</p>
