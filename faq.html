					<li><h3 style="color: red">Is there a scientific concensus on climate change?</h3></li>
						<p>Yes. All major scientific agencies of the United States including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-agree that climate change is occurring and that humans are contributing to it. In the 2014 National Climate Assessment, the Global Change Research Program concluded that "global climate is changing and this is apparent across the United States in a wide range of observations. The global warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuels."</p>

					<li><h3 style="color: red">What are the evidences that prove the climate is changing?</h3></li>	
					<p>Our understanding of climate change is based on multiple lines of evidence, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans, and is documented by hundreds of studies conducted by thousands of scientists around the world. We know how our climate has changed because of the physics of how our Earth system works, modeled simulations of past and future changes, and observations of recent trends in climate change indicators. For instance, records dating back to the 1800s show that the global average temperature increased by more than 1.5Â°F over the last century.</p>

				<li><h3 style="color: red">Is the hole in the ozone layer related to the climate change we are seeing today?</h3></li>
				<p>The ozone hole and climate change are two separate issues. The "ozone hole" refers to the destruction of a layer of ozone molecules found high in Earth's atmosphere. When healthy, this ozone layer helps to shield Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. The ozone layer has become thinner because of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons that were once commonly used in products ranging from spray cans to foam furniture cushions. A thinner ozone layer allows more ultraviolet rays to reach Earth, increasing the risk to humans from skin cancer, cataracts, and other health impacts. This, however, has only minor effects on climate change.</p>

					<li>
						<h3 style="color: red">What's the difference between a college and a university?</h3>
					</li>
					<p>A: Colleges offer only undergraduate degrees while universities offer graduate degrees as well, but the terms are often used interchangeably.</p>
					<li><h3 style="color: red">What is the difference between "Undergraduate" and "Graduate" degrees?</h3></li>
					<p>A: Undergraduate programs follow high school and lead to an associate (two-year) degree or a bachelor (four-year) degree. Graduate programs follow a bachelor's degree and lead to a master's or doctoral degree.</p>
					<li><h3 style="color: red">What are the different types of undergraduate degrees?</h3></li>
					<p>A: Associate: a two-year program that either leads to a specific vocation or transitions to a bachelor program. Bachelor: a four or five-year program where students earn credits in a wide variety of courses.</p>
					<li><h3 style="color: red">What are the different types of  graduate degrees?</h3></li>
					<p>A: Masters: two-year degree providing additional specialization. Doctorate: five to eight-year program certifying the student as a trained research scholar and/or professor.</p>
					<li><h3 style="color: red"> Is it possible to take a professional degree program without first earning a bachelor's degree?</h3></li>
					<p>A: Yes, but they are highly selective and require a heavy courseload across a total of six years of study.</p>
					<li><h3 style="color: red">Is it possible to obtain a bachelor's degree and a master's degree at the same time?</h3></li>
					<p>A: In a joint-degree program, students begin a graduate program in their fourth year of college, earning both degrees upon graduation.</p><h4><a href="FAQ.html" style="color: white">BACK TO TOP</a></h4>

			<h1 id="bullying">3.)Bullying</h1>
			
				<ul>
					<li><h3 style="color: red">What is school bullying?</h3></li>
						<p>Bullying is exposing a person to abusive actions repeatedly over time.1 Being aware of children's teasing and acknowledging injured feelings are always important. Bullying becomes a concern when hurtful or aggressive behavior toward an individual or group appears to be unprovoked, intentional, and (usually) repeated. </p>
						<p>Bullying is a form of violence. It involves a real or perceived imbalance of power, with the more powerful child or group attacking those who are less powerful. Bullying may be physical (hitting, kicking, spitting, pushing), verbal (taunting, malicious teasing, name calling, threatening), or emotional (spreading rumors, manipulating social relationships, extorting, or intimidating). Bullying can occur face-to-face or in the online world.</p>
						<p>Bullying is also one or more acts by a pupil or group of pupils directed against another pupil that constitutes sexual harassment, hate violence, or severe or pervasive intentional harassment, threats, or intimidation that is disruptive, causes disorder, and invades the rights of others by creating an intimidating or hostile educational environment, and includes acts that are committed personally or by means of an electronic act, as defined.</p>
						<p>An "electronic act" is defined as transmission of a communication, including, but not limited to, a message, text, sound, or image by means of an electronic devise, including but not limited to, a telephone, wireless telephone or other wireless communication device, computer, or pager.</p>
						<a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/ss/se/bullyfaq.asp">Reference</a>
						<h3 style="color: red">What do bullies do?</h3>
						<p>Bullying actions may be direct or indirect.</p>
						<p>Direct bullying or identifiable bullying actions may include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Hitting, tripping, shoving, pinching, and excessive tickling</li>
							<li>Verbal threats, name calling, racial slurs, and insults</li>
							<li>Demanding money, property, or some service to be performed</li>
							<li>Stabbing, choking, burning, and shooting </li>
						</ul>
						<p>Indirect bullying may be more difficult to detect and may include:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Rejecting, excluding, or isolating target(s)</li>
						<li>Humiliating target(s) in front of friends </li>
						<li>Manipulating friends and relationships</li>
						<li>Sending hurtful or threatening e-mail or writing notes</li>
						<li>Blackmailing, terrorizing, or posing dangerous dares</li>
						<li>Developing a Web site devoted to taunting, ranking, or degrading a target and inviting others to join in posting humiliating notes or messages.</li>
						</ul>
						<li><h3 style="color: red">What are the consequences of bullying?</h3></li>

						<p>Bullying among children often leads to greater and prolonged violence. Not only does bullying harm the targets, it also negatively affects students' ability to learn and achieve in school.</p>
						<h4>Consequences for the target</h4>
						<p>Students who are the target of a bully experience negative emotions. Feelings of persecution prevail over feelings of safety and confidence. Fear, anger, frustration, and anxiety may lead to ongoing illness, mood swings, withdrawal from friends and family, an inability to concentrate, and loss of interest in school. If left unattended, the targeted student may develop attendance and/or discipline problems, fail at school altogether or, in the worst cases, they are suicidal or retaliatory and violent. </p><h4><a href="FAQ.html" style="color: white">BACK TO TOP</a></h4>

				<h1 id="economy">4.)ECONOMY</h1>

					<ul>
						<li><h3 style="color: red">Is the fundamental structure of the world economy changing? </h3></li>
						<p> Yes, the global economy is undergoing a long-term, structural transformation. First, in the past 30 years, the contribution of key sectors to global output shifted: agriculture fell, manufacturing declined, and services rose as shares of global value added and employment. Second, capital expenditures are declining. Service -i.e. tech, digital -companies need little investment to prosper. For example,the fast-growing "sharing economy" -by relying on the Internet -cheaply interfaces vast supply systems (where the costs are) with a large number of customers (the demand, where the money is); in other words, by inexpensively putting underutilized resources to use, it creates value with little capital costs</p>
						<p>As a result, global net investment (gross investment minus depreciation, as a share of the total capital stock) is close to its lowest level since the Second World War. Third, demographic trends support a decline in investment and consumption, because: a) falling birth rates and a rising life expectancy are leading to aging populations, especially in developed markets (DMs); b) as the pool of working-age (15 to 64 years old) individuals shrinks in both DMs and EMs,firms deploy less capital -because there are fewer workers to hire; and c)as a result, labor-force participation rates,decline and consumers refrain from spending.</p>

						<li><h3 style="color: red">Why is productivity low, and savings keep rising?</h3></li>
						<p>The productivity boost of the "new economy" -the post-manufacturing, service-based economic system -is lower than in past industrial revolutions. After the 2008 financial crisis, labor productivity growth fell across sectors in most OECD countries, where 45 million workers are jobless. While technological progress and business automation are making white collar jobs redundant, traditional middle-class jobs disappear. Savings keep growing: first, as inequality rises, a higher share of income goes to richer individuals, with higher-propensity-to-save. Second, since 2008 EMs have accumulated massive foreign-exchange reserves and the world's main Central Banks (CBs) nearly doubled -from USD 10.1tn to USD 18.2tn -their combined balance sheets.</p>
						<p>Third, corporations relentlessly accumulate retained earnings. Fourth, this rising supply of savings is rather unresponsive to interest rates cuts; hence, lower CB policy-rates do not boost spending. As a result, and despite historically-low interest rates, economic growth stagnates, along with inflation. In many economies, with short-term interest rates close-to-zero and declining prices, achieving full employment becomes a real challenge. In line with the secular stagnation hypothesis, negative real interest rates might be needed to equate saving and investment with full employment.</p>

						<li><h3 style="color: red">Has globalization increased co-dependence and systemic risks?</h3></li>
						<p>Yes: rapid cross-border economic, social, technological exchange enhanced interconnections, increasing resilience, but also fragility. Capital has become an (often unpredictable) driving force, more influential and systemic than trade. The foreign exchange market grew to be the world's largest market, with average daily trading volumes in excess of USD4 trillion (tn). Via macro-financial linkages, 25 economies -because of their size and connections with other countries -can have a systemic impact on the performance of the global economy and its financial stability, and need regular monitoring.  As the scale of financial flows and their volatility rise in a context of lower growth and higher uncertainty, economic interdependencies increase risks rather than diminishing them, and financial crises became more recurrent. For example, the sudden unwinding of global imbalances (see 4. below) could work as a "crisis-transmission-mechanism". Indeed, over the past six years, EMs -forced to invest their reserves in large liquid debt markets -kept financing deficits in large DMs; the holding of US sovereign debt by Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) almost doubled from USD 1.0tn (December 2008) to USD 1.7tn (September 2015)</p>

						<li><h3 style="color: red">Why is international monetary system neither preventing currency volatility nor fostering an efficient allocation of global capital? </h3></li>
						<p>Over the past few years, most currencies' exchange-rates fluctuated at an unprecedented pace, hampering capital transfers and commercial activity. Overtime, uncoordinated competitive devaluations (i.e. currency wars) aimed at supporting and boosting national economic activity could foster protectionism. EM foreign-exchange holdings, at two-thirds of the total, de facto reduce global demand. Indeed, while they should invest in their local economy, EMs end up lending cheaply to (wealthier) economies that need to save rather than spend. In other words, reserve accumulation increases global imbalances and -by pushing down long-term interest rates -sows the seeds of future financial instability. A major re-thinking is needed. To ensure capital flows, trade relations, and global prosperity, the monetary system needs a few internationally-trusted currencies-the so-called "global reserve currencies". These currencies facilitate the setting of prices, the payment of goods and services in global markets, the holdings by governments and institutions of foreign exchange reserves, the denomination of balance sheets for both public and private actors, and the accumulation of savings and (central) bank reserves.</p>

						<li><h3 style="color: red">The global economy is weak, the markets are strong. Is the financial system reaching an unstable equilibrium? Will it end in tears?</h3></li>
						<p>The disconnection between (stock and bond) markets and fundamentals is due to abundant macro-liquidity and repeated CB intervention. After years of complacency, data signal risks ahead: across the world, growth is slowing; leading indicators point to a mild global recession, driven by an EM slowdown (see 5. above); volatility and financial stress are rising and macro-liquidity is not translating into consistent market-liquidity. Policy interventions are unlikely to be effective. In this context, CBs risk making policy mistakes and, eventually, losing credibility. The recent episode of market volatility was an early-warning: when CBs start tightening, a bear-market correction will ensue and asset prices will decline to match fundamentals. Capital preservation via a defensive asset allocation is priority. Yet, unusual portfolios-less liquid and more volatile -are likely to perform better than conventional ones.</p>

						<li><h3 style="color: red">Are investment returns likely to be lower than in recent years?</h3></li>
						<p>Not necessarily, because the tradeoff between sustained growth and financial stability is likely to continue, buoying volatility. On paper, financial markets should favor -with the orderly functioning of transnational financial flows -sustainable growth and financial stability. Over the past few years, however, economic growth could only be achieved via the build-up of debt and asset bubbles. This is likely to continue. In bond markets,regulators by forcing institutional investors to invest in triple-A assets, while the supply of these assets has declined by 50 percent -are pushing real interest rate even lower. Yields on sovereign and corporate bonds, which pay a spread over government debt, have fallen in tandem. The quest for financial safety has brought about severe safe-asset shortages and, eventually, deficits in aggregate demand. Conversely, in the equity markets, historically-low real-interest-rates have pushed asset prices high and created asset bubbles, boosting investors' returns via capital gains. However, as profits grow in line with the economy, investment income (the dividend yield) steadily declined. In sum, volatility will remain high going forward, and traders will perform better than fundamental investors.</p><h4><a href="FAQ.html" style="color: white">BACK TO TOP</a></h4>
